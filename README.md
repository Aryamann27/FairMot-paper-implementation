# FairMOT: PyTorch Implementation

A clean, end‐to‐end PyTorch implementation of **FairMOT** (“Fair Multi‐Object Tracking”), the joint detection and embedding framework for real‐time tracking introduced by Zhang *et al.*.

## 📖 Overview

FairMOT unifies an anchor-free object detector (CenterNet) with a parallel re-identification branch, ensuring balanced and high‐quality detection and appearance embedding. This results in state-of-the-art real-time multiple object tracking (MOT) performance without separate detection and association stages.
